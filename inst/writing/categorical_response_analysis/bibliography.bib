  abstract = {This paper examines Japan's experience in the first half of the 1990s to shed some light on several issues that arise as inflation declines toward zero. Is it possible to recognize when an economy is moving into a phase of sustained deflation? How quickly should monetary policy respond to sharp declines in inflation? Are there factors that inhibit the monetary transmission mechanism as interest rates approach zero? What is the role for fiscal policy in warding off a deflationary episode? We conclude that Japan's sustained deflationary slump was very much unanticipated by Japanese policymakers and observers alike, and that this was a key factor in the authorities? failure to provide sufficient stimulus to maintain growth and positive inflation. Once inflation turned negative and short-term interest rates approached the zero-lower-bound, it became much more difficult for monetary policy to reactivate the economy. We found little compelling evidence that in the lead up to deflation in the first half of the 1990s, the ability of either monetary or fiscal policy to help support the economy fell off significantly. Based on all these considerations, we draw the general lesson from Japan's experience that when inflation and interest rates have fallen close to zero, and the risk of deflation is high, stimulus, both monetary and fiscal, should go beyond the levels conventionally implied by baseline forecasts of future inflation and economic activity.},

  abstract = {In flowering plants, the onset and duration of female receptivity vary among species. In several species the receptive structures wilt upon pollination. Here we explore the hypothesis that postpollination wilting may be influenced by pollen and serve as a general means to secure paternity of the pollen donor at the expense of female fitness. Taking a game-theoretical approach, we examine the potential for the evolution of a pollen-borne wilting substance, and for the coevolution of a defense strategy by the recipient plant. The model without defense predicts an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the production of wilting substance. The ESS value is highest when pollinator visiting rates are intermediate and when the probability that pollen from several donors arrives at the same time is low. This finding has general implications in that it shows that male traits to secure paternity also can evolve in species, such as plants, where mating is not strictly sequential. We further model coevolution of the wilting substance with the timing of stigma receptivity. We assume that pollen-receiving plants can reduce the costs induced by toxic pollen by delaying the onset of stigmatic receptivity. The model predicts a joint ESS, but no female counter-adaptation when the wilting substance is highly toxic. This indicates that toxicity affects the probability that a male manipulative trait stays beneficial (i.e., not countered by female defense) over evolutionary time. We discuss parallels to male induced changes in female receptivity known to occur in animals and the role of harm for the evolution of male manipulative adaptations.},

The hypothesis advanced and empirically examined in this paper suggests that there are socioeconomic trade-offs associated with genetic diversity within a given society. The investigation exploits an exogenous source of cross-country variation in genetic diversity by appealing to the "out of Africa" hypothesis of human origins to empirically establish a highly statistically significant and robust non-monotonic effect of genetic diversity on development outcomes in the pre-colonial era. Contrary to theories that reject a possible role for human genetics in influencing economic development, this study demonstrates the economic significance of diversity in genetic traits, while abstaining entirely from conceptual frameworks that posit a hierarchy of such traits in terms of their conduciveness to the process of economic development.},

Mathematicians quickly pointed out that the purported revolution was relying on the abstract theory of dynamical systems founded in the late 19th century by Henri Poincar{\'e} who had already reached a similar conclusion. In this paper, we flesh out the historiographical tensions arising from these confrontations: longue-dur{\'e}e history and revolution; abstract mathematics and the use of mathematical techniques in various other domains. After reviewing the historiography of dynamical systems theory from Poincar{\'e} to the 1960s, we highlight the pioneering work of a few individuals (Steve Smale, Edward Lorenz, David Ruelle). We then go on to discuss the nature of the chaos phenomenon, which, we argue, was a conceptual reconfiguration as much as a sociodisciplinary convergence. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Reporting of effect size in the psychological literature is patchy - though this may be changing - and when reported it is far from clear that appropriate effect size statistics are employed. This paper considers the practice of reporting point estimates of standardized effect size and explores factors such as reliability, range restriction and differences in design that distort standardized effect size unless suitable corrections are employed. For most purposes simple (unstandardized) effect size is more robust and versatile than standardized effect size. Guidelines for deciding what effect size metric to use and how to report it are outlined. Foremost among these are: (i) a preference for simple effect size over standardized effect size, and (ii) the use of confidence intervals to indicate a plausible range of values the effect might take. Deciding on the appropriate effect size statistic to report always requires careful thought and should be influenced by the goals of the researcher, the context of the research and the potential needs of readers.},

However, little is known about the chemical arsenal employed by stony corals, despite their ecological importance. Here, we show large differences in the density of nematocysts and whole-body hemolytic activity between different species of reef-building corals. In the branched coral Stylophora pistillata, the tips of the branches exhibited a greater hemolytic activity than the bases. Hemolytic activity and nematocyst density were significantly lower in Stylophora that were maintained for close to a year in captivity compared to corals collected from the wild. A cysteine-containing actinoporin was identified in Stylophora following partial purification and tandem mass spectrometry. This toxin, named {$\Delta$}-Pocilopotoxin-Spi1 ({$\Delta$}-PCTX-Spi1) is the first hemolytic toxin to be partially isolated and characterized in true reef-building corals. Loss of hemolytic activity during chromatography suggests that this actinoporin is only one of potentially several hemolytic molecules.

  abstract = {Bad economic times are typically associated with a high incidence of financial distress, e.g., insolvency and bankruptcy. This paper studies the role of changes in borrower solvency in the initiation and propagation of the business cycle. We first develop a model of the process of financing real investment projects under asymmetric information, extending work by Robert Townsend. A major conclusion here is that when the entrepreneurs who borrow to finance projects are more solvent (have more "collateral"), the deadweight agency costs of investment finance are lower. This model of investment finance is then embedded in a dynamic macroeconomic setting. We show that, first, since reductions in collateral in bad times increase the agency costs of borrowing, which in turn depress the demand for investment, the presence of these financial factors will tend to amplify swings in real output. Second, we find that autonomous factors which affect the collateral of borrowers (as in a "debt-deflation") can actually initiate cycles in output.},

  abstract = {This chapter develops a dynamic general equilibrium model that is intended to help clarify the role of credit market frictions in business fluctuations, from both a qualitative and a quantitative standpoint. The model is a synthesis of the leading approaches in the literature. In particular, the framework exhibits a "financial accelerator", in that endogenous developments in credit markets work to amplify and propagate shocks to the macroeconomy. In addition, we add several features to the model that are designed to enhance the empirical relevance. First, we incorporate money and price stickiness, which allows us to study how credit market frictions may influence the transmission of monetary policy. In addition, we allow for lags in investment which enables the model to generate both hump-shaped output dynamics and a lead-lag relation between asset prices and investment, as is consistent with the data. Finally, we allow for heterogeneity among firms to capture the fact that borrowers have differential access to capital markets. Under reasonable parametrizations of the model, the financial accelerator has a significant influence on business cycle dynamics. {\copyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this lecture I survey the current state of our knowledge about the Depression from a comparative perspective. On the aggregate demand side of the economy, comparative analysis has greatly strengthened the empirical case for monetary shocks as a major driving force of the Depression; an interesting possibility suggested by this analysis is that the worldwide monetary collapse that began in 1931 may be interpreted as a jump from one Nash equilibrium to another. On the aggregate supply side, comparative empirical studies provide support for both induced financial crisis and sticky nominal wages as mechanisms by which nominal shocks had real effects. Still unresolved is why nominal wages did not adjust more quickly in the face of mass unemployment. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

' It has been a common practice to use the displacement of springs as a measure of force, and previous methods have relied on electrostatic fields, magnetostatic fields, optical waves, and x rays. Jones{\textasciitilde} has reviewed the devices that use variable capacitances and he reports that dis-placements of 10 4 A can be measured. SQUIDs3 are superconducting elements that measure the expulsion of magnetic fields in variable-inductance devices. They are used in gravity gradiometers to measure dis-placements of 10 6 A. Tabor and co-workers in their work with van der Waals forces have used optical in-terference methods to measure displacements of 1 A. With an x-ray interferometer constructed from a single crystal of silicon, Deslattes' has also measured dis-placements of 10 A which is about 1'/0 of the nuclear diameter. We are proposing a new system wherein the STM is used to measure the motion of a cantilever beam with an ultrasmall mass. The force required to move this beam through measurable distances (10 A) can be as small as 10 ' N. The masses involved in the other techniques are too large to reach this value. This level of sensitivity clearly penetrates the regime of inter-atomic forces between single atoms and opens the door to a variety of applications. The atomic force micro-scope (AFM) is a new tool designed to exploit this lev-el of sensitivity. It will be used to investigate both conductors and insulators on an atomic scale. \%e en-vision a general-purpose device that will measure any type of force; not only the interatomic forces, but elec-tromagnetic forces as well. \%ith the STM, 6 the atomic surface structure of con-ductors is well resolved. For bulk insulators7 an equivalent method is missing although the stylus profi-lometer (SP)8 9 has been developed into a powerful microscopic technique. Teague et al. ' have used the SP to record three-dimensional images of surfaces with a lateral resolution of 1000 A and a vertical resolution of 10 A. A related technique is the scanning capaci-tance microscope described by Matey and Blanc. " They report a lateral resolution of 5000 A and a verti-cal resolution of 2 A. The SP has much in common with the STM. The tip in the STM and the stylus in the SP are both used to scan the surface, sense the variations of the sample, and generate three-dimensional images. The stylus in the profilometer is carried by a cantilever beam and it rides on the sample surface. This means that a rough surface can be plastically deformed. " The radius of this stylus is about 1 p, m, and the loading force ex-tends from 10 to 10 N. ' The spring in the AFM is a critical component. \%e need the maximum deflection for a given force. This requires a spring that is as soft as possible. At the same time a stiff spring with high resonant frequency is necessary in order to minimize the sensitivity to vi-brational noise from the building near 100 Hz. The resonant frequency, fo, of the spring system is given by f0= (I/2sr)(k/nto)', where k is the spring con-stant and ttto is the effective mass that loads the spring. This relation suggests a simple way out of our dilem-ma. As we decrease k to soften the spring we must also decrease mo to keep the ratio k/mo large. The limiting case, illustrated in Fig. 1, is but a single atom adsorbed at site A in the gap of an STM. It has its own mass and an effective k that comes from the coupling to neighboring atoms. The mass of the spring in manmade structures can be quite small but eventually microfabrication'4 will be employed to fabricate a spring with a mass less than 10 '0 kg and a resonant frequency greater than 2 kHz. Displacements of 10 A can be measured with the STM when the tunneling gap is modulated.

  abstract = {The rhetoric of deflation has become more prevalent in policy circles and in the press despite the fact that deflation has been a rare phenomenon in modern fiat currency economies. To better understand the nature of deflation, this paper looks back to a period when deflation was a regular feature of the economic environment, across both time and a wide set of countries. One feature of the deflation record stands clear. During the 19th century and early 20th century, deflation was not generally associated with persistent and deep economic malaise. Most periods of deflation also appear to have been largely unanticipated, with interest rates rarely approaching their zero lower bound. One notable exception to this typical pattern was the Great Depression of the early 1930s, the event that nowadays colours current general perceptions of what deflationary episodes might look like. At the risk of oversimplification, one way to think about this broad sweep of history is that deflations come in three basic types: the good, the bad and the ugly. The paper then jumps forward in time, seeking to draw lessons from the past about the possibility of future episodes of deflation and their characteristics. In doing so, it pays particular attention to the similarities and differences in the monetary and financial regimes prevailing now and in the past. While great care should be taken in any such exercise, the paper concludes that certain features of the past can help to shed some light on the policy challenges that policymakers might face in the future.},

In the experiment described below, the recording of part of the unresolved vibration-rotation spectrum of gaseous sulfur dioxide (1,2,17, 19) enables the student to obtain the three fundamental frequencies of the molecule, heat capacity data, bond angle, and stretching and bending force constants. The stretching force constant can be compared with those of the sulfur trioxide molecule (5) and the sulfur monoxide radical (4), calculated from data in the references cited or from supplied abstracts of them. Most students are im-pressed by the wealth of results derivable from the relatively small amount of practical work which is involved in this experiment. They should be made aware, though, that the reasonable concordance of the spectroscopic and calorimetric heat capacities, of the vibration-rotation and electron diffraction bond angle values, and the similarity of the calculated SO, SO2, and SO8 force constants is a convincing verification of the general soundness of the different elaborate theories, and especially of any assumptions necessary to the development of these theories.},

Typically literature within disability studies has concentrated on the practices and production of disablism, examining attitudes and barriers that contribute to the subordination of people with disabilities in society. My exploration occurs through examining the insights of critical race theory (CRT) and the contribution that CRT can further make to thinking through the processes, formation and consequences of ableism. A focal concern is the possible ways that the concept of internalized racism, its deployment in CRT and application to critical disability studies. The paper is interested in working through points of difference between the way internalized racism/ableism are mediated in the processes of subjectification and identifying points of convergence that can benefit dialogue across varied sites of scholarship. The author concludes that the study of ableism instead of disability/disablement may produce different research questions and sites of study},

Sharp differences exist between Japan in the 1990s and the 1930s environment; however, this paper takes the position there are qualitative similarities that cannot be ignored in terms of financial distress, downward price trends, debate over appropriate central bank policy, and how legal independence may constrain appropriate central bank policy. The paper reviews the evolution of views about policy targets from the 1930s to the present to show how price stability reemerged as the primary policy target. Evidence on the success central banks have achieved in achieving price stability is reviewed. The evidence shows that claims central banks have overemphasized controlling inflation at the expense of deflation, is incorrect with the exception of Japan. The paper reviews the role of the Federal Reserve in the 1930s to show that failure to prevent deflation during the critical 1929-1933 period had adverse impacts on the economy and resulted in rending the Federal Reserve de facto dependent on the government despite its legal independence. The paper then considers the experiences of Japan and Sweden in the 1930s to provide counter examples to how the U.S. economy might have responded to central bank policy designed to prevent deflation. In both cases, policies explicitly designed to reverse the downward movement in prices reduced the economic and financial distress in those countries compared to the United States. The paper draws implications from the historical record for Bank of Japan policy and suggests that more aggressive action would have been appropriate in the 1990s and that further institutional change toward inflation targeting should be considered.},

  abstract = {In this paper we review the history of deflation in China, Japan, and the United States, and summarize the stylized empirical facts regarding deflation and key real and monetary variables in these economies. Based on a review of the institutional background of deflation in these economies, we argue that deflation in China is largely supply-led, whereas deflation in Japan is demand-led. We discuss the adverse effects of demand-led deflation, and argue that deflation is not simply inflation in reverse. Based on these adverse effects, we explain the basis of a discontinuity in the monetary policy process, and contrast the discontinuity process with the 1930s-era liquidity trap concept. We then provide empirical evidence on an important link in the discontinuity process: the effect of demand-led deflation on money demand. We consider a variety of money demand function estimates for Japan, China, and the United States in order to illustrate that deflation in Japan may have indeed contributed to a discontinuity in monetary policy by shifting the demand for money upward, and we then suggest several implications for central bank policy in a deflationary environment. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Each requires the introduction of a set of covariates, which remains difficult to choose, especially regarding the different methods. We conduct a simulation study to compare the relative performance results obtained by using four different sets of covariates (those causing the outcome, those causing the treatment allocation, those causing both the outcome and the treatment allocation, and all the covariates) and four methods: g-computation, inverse probability of treatment weighting, full matching and targeted maximum likelihood estimator. Our simulations are in the context of a binary treatment, a binary outcome and baseline confounders. The simulations suggest that considering all the covariates causing the outcome led to the lowest bias and variance, particularly for g-computation. The consideration of all the covariates did not decrease the bias but significantly reduced the power. We apply these methods to two real-world examples that have clinical relevance, thereby illustrating the real-world importance of using these methods. We propose an R package RISCA to encourage the use of g-computation in causal inference.},

This method leads to a natural graph-theoretical description of nonlinear systems with qualities in the spirit of symbolic dynamics. We support our claim via the case study of the period-doubling and band-splitting attractor cascades that characterize unimodal maps. We provide a universal analytical description of this classic scenario in terms of the horizontal visibility graphs associated with the dynamics within the attractors, that we call Feigenbaum graphs, independent of map nonlinearity or other particulars. We derive exact results for their degree distribution and related quantities, recast them in the context of the renormalization group and find that its fixed points coincide with those of network entropy optimization. Furthermore, we show that the network entropy mimics the Lyapunov exponent of the map independently of its sign, hinting at a Pesin-like relation equally valid out of chaos.},

The motivations that have generated it, describing a whole of interdependencies, interactions, are clear and convincing. But a question remains: if the situation is so clear a posterior why economists have not been able to foresee it? What is happening to economic science if it is not able to recognize an economic crisis before it "steps on it"? How is it possible that the economic science was caught off guard yet again? Besides, what is the implication for the status of economics as a science if it is not able to successfully deal with real economic problems? The aim of the paper is to show the weakness of traditional economic theory and what improvements in terms of description and foresight could be obtained applying chaos theory to the study of economic phenomena.

  abstract = {The relationship between wage inflation and unemployment has been extensively investigated since the early work of Phillips [Phillips, A.W., 1958. The relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the U.K. 1861--1957. Economica 25, 283--299] and Lipsey [Lipsey, R.G., 1960. The relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the U.K. 1861--1957: a further analysis. Economica 27, 1--31], and it is still a matter of debate. In this paper we study the dynamics of a standard neoclassical labour market under the simplest Walrasian adjustment rule. We show that when consumption and leisure are sufficiently low substitutes, the unique Walrasian equilibrium of the economy can be destabilised, and regular or even chaotic fluctuations of wages and employment appear. This leads to an interesting resurrection of a real wage Phillips curve as a long-term phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The paper elicits a mechanism by which private leverage choices exhibit strategic complementarities through the reaction of monetary policy. When everyone engages in maturity transformation, authorities haver little choice but facilitating refinancing. In turn, refusing to adopt a risky balance sheet lowers the return on equity. The key ingredient is that monetary policy is non-targeted. The ex post benefits from a monetary bailout accrue in proportion to the number amount of leverage, while the distortion costs are to a large extent fixed. This insight has important consequences. First, banks choose to correlate their risk exposures. Second, private borrowers may deliberately choose to increase their interest-rate sensitivity following bad news about future needs for liquidity. Third, optimal monetary policy is time inconsistent. Fourth, macro-prudential supervision is called for. We characterize the optimal regulation, which takes the form of a minimum liquidity requirement coupled with monitoring of the quality of liquid assets. We establish the robustness of our insights when the set of bailout instruments is endogenous and characterize the structure of optimal bailouts.},

In the preface, I stated that the results "seem largely new," I spoke thus cautiously because of my unfamiliarity with the vast literature on the subject. Since the book was published its special conclusions have been widely accepted and, so far as I know, no one has yet found them anticipated by previous writers, though several, including myself, have zealously sought to find such anticipations. Two of the best-read authorities in this field assure me that those conclusions are, in the words of one of them, "both new and important." Partly to specify what some of these special conclusions are which are believed to be new and partly to fit them into the conclusions of other students in this field, I am offering this paper as embodying, in brief, my present "creed" on the whole subject of so-called "cycle theory." My "creed" consists of 49 "articles" some of which are old and some new. I say "creed" because, for brevity, it is purposely expressed dogmatically and without proof. But it is not a creed in the sense that my faith in it does not rest on evidence and that I am not ready to modify it on presentation of new evidence. On the contrary, it is quite tentative. It may serve as a challenge to others and as raw material to help them work out a better product. Meanwhile the following is a list of my 49 tentative conclusions.},

Most mathematicians encounter the result for the first time in graduate school and file it away in their strange results category (along with space-filling curves, Cantor functions, and non-measurable sets). But in spite of the relative simplicity of the proof, discovered by Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski in 1924 and hinging on the Axiom of Choice, many mathematicians go no further than the lay scientist who comes across the result.},

Comparison of the obtained and standard spectra revealed that the same aromatic hydrocarbons (including, in part: benzene, the xylenes, naphthalene, and methylated naphthalenes) were present in all three samples. Percentage values for these and other aromatic hydrocarbons were then generated and tabulated.},

Methods and procedure: Sixty-six primary caregivers of school-age children who experienced a TBI within the previous 2 years were interviewed regarding what types of special support were needed by and provided for their children during the 3 months immediately following school re-entry. They then rated how difficult it was to obtain support or services from the school and how satisfied they were with the support or services. Main outcomes and results: The majority of participants did not perceive the need for school-based services, even when the injury was severe. Almost all students whose parents perceived a need for an adjusted schedule were granted that accommodation, but few students received school-based counselling or behavioural support. Conclusions: Results indicated that participants perceived relatively few school-based supports, particularly given the actual academic, behavioural and social challenges experienced by children who have sustained a TBI. Schools and hospitals must take steps to ensure appropriate post-head injury support services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The most widely used technique for atomic-resolution force microscopy in vacuum is frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM). This technique, as well as other dynamic methods, is explained in detail in this article. In the last few years many groups have expanded the empirical knowledge and deepened our theoretical understanding of frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy. Consequently spatial resolution and ease of use have been increased dramatically. Vacuum atomic force microscopy opens up new classes of experiments, ranging from imaging of insulators with true atomic resolution to the measurement of forces between individual atoms.},

Prior research has identified a set of interpersonal factors (e.g., team communication, team trust) that help attenuate this association. The purpose of this article is to provide an alternative perspective that focuses on the moderating role of performance-related factors (i.e., perceived team performance). Using social identity theory, we build a model that predicts how task conflict associates with growth in relationship conflict and how perceived team performance influences this association. We test a three-wave longitudinal model by means of random coefficient growth modeling, using data from 60 ongoing teams working in a health care organization. Results provide partial support for our hypotheses. Only when perceived team performance is low, do task conflicts relate with growth in relationship conflict. We conclude that perceived team performance seems to enable teams to uncouple task from relationship conflict.},

We document that this trust is affected not only by the characteristics of the country being trusted, but also by cultural aspects of the match between trusting country and trusted country, such as religion, history of conflicts, and genetic and somatic similarities. We then find that lower bilateral trust leads to less trade between two countries, less portfolio investment, and less direct investment, even after controlling for the characteristics of the two countries. This effect is stronger for goods that are more trust intensive. Our results suggest that perceptions rooted in culture are important (and generally omitted) determinants of economic exchange. * We would like to thank Giuseppe Nicoletti for providing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development dataset, Michele Gambera for providing the Morningstar portfolio data and Roc Armenter for his excellent job as a research assistant.

The present study investigated in patients with major depression (MD) whether the subscales are a comparable option to predict treatment remission in the early course of treatment.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Based on data from 210 MD patients of a 6-week randomised, placebo-controlled trial comparing mirtazapine (MIR) and paroxetine (PAR), the discriminative and predictive validity of EI for (stable) remission at treatment end was evaluated for seven subscales and the HAMD17 in the total and in treatment subgroups (MIR vs. PAR). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (at week 2) and the Clinical Global Impression scales (CGI) (at study endpoint) were used to validate the 20\% EI criterion for the subscales.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Only the Evans6 and Toronto7 subscale had almost the same predictive value as the HAMD17 (e.g., sensitivities stable remission Evans6/Toronto7: 96/95\% vs. 96\% HAMD17). The optimal cut-off for EI to predict remission was just below 20\% for most subscales and slightly over 20\% for stable remission.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nLIMITATIONS: Study sample representativeness, non-independence of subscales, missing external validation criterion, lack of control group.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The Evans6 and Toronto7 subscales are valuable alternatives in situations, where economic aspects play a larger role. A sum score reduction of {$\geq$}20\% as definition for EI seems also appropriate for the HAMD subscales, in the total as well as in the antidepressant subgroups.},

Productivity shocks are the only source of aggregate fluctuations and the central bank acts as a discretionary policy maker that pursues an inflation targeting strategy. We use this model to assess the effects of fiscal policy in a liquidity trap, the consequences of a commitment to change government expenditures in the future as well as the implications of lower taxes on labor and a higher inflation target. In contrast with some previous papers, we find that the effects of fiscal policy in a liquidity trap are moderate and that reductions in labor income taxes are expansionary. We do not find support for higher inflation targets.},

This paper characterises optimal monetary policy analytically in a New Keynesian economy with capital and a financial accelerator. In addition to stabilising inflation, there is an incentive to smooth volatility in the net worth of borrowers and this presents a trade-off for monetary policy. This trade-off can be eliminated if policymakers can additionally choose an optimal transfer to borrowers. Enriching the model with fire sales and countercyclical bankruptcy costs, there is also an incentive to smooth volatility in default and the capital stock. An optimal transfer to borrowers is not sufficient to eliminate the trade-off in that case. With fewer instruments than targets, optimal transfers are state contingent and countercyclical, while monetary policy stabilises inflation.},

This volume fills the gap by presenting a collection of the essential articles that define and develop the real business cycle school, as well as those that criticize it. Key areas covered include: {$\bullet$} the establishment of the real business cycle program {$\bullet$} the aims and methods of the real business cycle school {$\bullet$} analysis of the statistics and econometrics of the calibration techniques advocated by real businesss cycle modelers {$\bullet$} assessment of the empirical success of the real business cycle model from a variety of methods and perspectives {$\bullet$} the measurement of technology shocks in business cycle models (the Solow residual). A detailed Introduction assesses the strengths and weaknesses of real business cycle theory from a critical perspective and includes a non- technical User's Guide to the formulation and solution of models which will aid understanding of the articles and issues discussed. Offering a thorough assessment of the real business cycle program, this volume will be a vital resource for students and professionals in macroeconomics.},

Control samples were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline. Fibroin was shown to proteolytically degrade with predictable rates of change in fibroin diameter, failure strength, cycles to failure, and mass. SEM indicated increasing fragmentation of individual fibroin filaments from protease-digested samples with time of exposure to the enzyme; particulate debris was present within 7 days of incubation. Gel electrophoresis indicated a decreasing amount of the silk 25 kDa light chain and a shift in the molecular weight of the heavy chain with increasing incubation time in protease. Results support that silk is a mechanically robust biomaterial with predictable long-term degradation characteristics.},

The Japanese policies were only partially successful in recapitalizing the banks until the economy finally started to recover in 2003. From these unsuccessful attempts, we derive eight lessons. In light of these eight lessons, we assess the policies the U.S. has pursued. The U.S. has ignored three of the lessons and it is too early to evaluate the U.S. policies with respect to four of the others.

The paper is quite critical of the conduct of monetary policy, particularly from 1998 to 2003. The Bank of Japan's rhetoric was not helpful in fighting deflation, and the interest rate hike in August 2000 amid deflation was a serious mistake. Deflation can be quite costly, and a key element in both preventing and escaping deflation is the management of expectations, using either price level or inflation targeting, because the zero lower bound on interest rates means that the overnight interest rate can no longer be used as the instrument of monetary policy. This paper proposes how to best manage expectations to exit deflation. Price-level targeting overcomes theoretical problems, such as need for a history dependent strategy, associated with inflation targeting. However, because actions speak louder than words, management of expectations also involves non-conventional monetary policies, a combination of which might have to be tried to help the Japanese economy escape its deflationary trap.},

Jorgenson then used the resulting implied optimal capi- tal stock to derive an econometric equation for investment. Generalizations of the Jorgenson framework (e.g., to allow for more general production functions) made this the standard approach to the empirical study of the determinants of investment. The user cost of capital also became the key concept for the theoretical study of the effects of alternative tax rules.},

The variety of forms which the autocatalytic curve can assume is evidence of the futility of such an attempted proof.},

Universal design for learning (UDL) has provided educators with a framework for differentiation to address learner differences. Using UDL principles without explicitly considering how cultural differences and perspectives affect learning may increase the disparity in student achievement for students of color. Likewise, the same applies to the effect of socioeconomic status or language development on students' preparation for learning in a ``typical'' school environment. Culturally responsive pedagogies prompt educators to design instruction from the perspective of students' diversity as strengths rather than deficits. Frequently overlooked aspects of culturally responsive pedagogy are compared with the facets of the UDL framework to provide teachers with additional considerations when planning for effective instruction.},

The question of how large these risks are has been subject to considerable public debate. We find that, as of September 2002 when this question first arose, there was no evidence of substantial deflation risks for the United States and for Germany, contrary to some conjectures at the time. In contrast, there was evidence of substantial deflation risks in Japan.},

Applying this approach to deflationary or near-zero inflation environments is problematic, however, and this paper examines two shortcomings of particular relevance to the Japanese case of the last decade. One is the unusually high degree of uncertainty associated with potential output in an environment of prolonged stagnation and deflation. Consequently, reaction function-based assessments of Japanese monetary policy are so sensitive to the chosen gauge of potential output as to be unreliable. The second shortcoming is the neglect of policy expectations, which become critically important as nominal interest rates approach zero. Using long-term bond yields, we identify five episodes since 1996 characterized by abrupt declines in Japanese inflation expectations. Policies undertaken by the Bank of Japan during this period did little to stabilize expectations, and the August 2000 interest rate increase appears to have intensified deflationary concerns.},

Moreover, fractal series convert into scale-free networks, enhancing the fact that power law degree distributions are related to fractality, something highly discussed recently. Some remarkable examples and analytical tools are outlined in order to test the method's reliability. Many different measures, recently developed in the complex network theory, could by means of this new approach characterize time series from a new point of view.},

Given the dismal aca- demic performance of many African American students (The College Board, 1985), I am not surprised that various administrators, teachers, and teacher edu- cators have asked me to share and discuss my findings so that they might incorporate them in their work. One usual response to what I share is the comment around which I have based this article, "But, that's just good teaching!" Instead of some "magic bullet" or intricate formula and steps for instruction, some members of my audience are shocked to hear what seems to them like some rather routine teaching strat- egies that are a part of good teaching. My response is to affirm that, indeed, I am describing good teach- ing, and to question why so little of it seems to be occurring in the classrooms populated by African American students. The pedagogical excellence I have studied is good teaching, but it is much more than that. This article is an attempt to describe a pedagogy I have come to identify as "culturally relevant" (Ladson- Billings, 1992a) and to argue for its centrality in the academic success of African American and other children who have not been well served by our nation's public schools. First, I provide some background in- Gloria Ladson-Billings is associate professor of educa- tion at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. formation about other attempts to look at linkages between school and culture. Next, I discuss the theo- retical grounding of culturally relevant teaching in the context of a 3-year study of successful teachers of African American students.

  abstract = {(from the foreword) The Brilliance of Black Children in Mathematics: Beyond the Numbers and Toward a New Discourse is a book that will make the sort of significant contribution needed to help promote and guide the transformation of the mathematical experiences of African American children. This is a book about possibilities and hope, in which the successes and resiliency of Black children are highlighted. There is an intense focus throughout the book on the brilliance of children who, because of the nation's obsession with the achievement gap, are frequently portrayed as inherently less capable. It also draws attention to the beauty of African American culture and the marginalization of that culture within mainstream U.S. culture. The authors of the chapters in this unique book offer narratives rarely included in the mainstream mathematics education literature. Moreover, the content of this book supports the ongoing formation of a new paradigm in the research literature in which the potentialities of all students are valued and nurtured in schools. The following sections include chapters on policy, learning, ethnomathematics, student identity, and teacher preparation as it relates to the mathematical education of Black children. Through offering "counterstories" about mathematically successful Black youth, advocating for a curriculum that is grounded in African American culture and ways of thinking, providing shining examples of the brilliance of Black students, and promoting high expectations for all rather than situating students as the problem, the authors of this book provide powerful insights related to the teaching and learning of mathematics for African American students. As is made evident in this book, effective teaching involves much more than just engaging students in inquiry-based pedagogy (Kitchen, 2003).

When the fibroin sheet was exposed to collagenase IA, the amount of Silk II crystalline structure in the sheets decreased slightly, and a small amount of Silk I crystalline structure was formed. When protease XIV was used, almost all Silk II disappeared, but the crystallinity increased overall because the amount of Silk I increased. During digestion with protease XIV, the pore size of the fibroin sheets increased with increasing degradation time, until the sheets finally collapsed and became totally shapeless. The average molecular weight of the products after degradation with the three enzymes followed the order protease XIV {$<$} collagenase IA {$<$} {$\alpha$}-chymotrypsin.

  abstract = {For the applied economist, the confident and appar- ently successful application of Keynesian principles to economic policy which occurred in the United States in the 1960s was an event of incomparable significance and satisfaction. These principles led to a set of simple, quantitative relationships between fiscal policy and economic activity generally, the ba- sic logic of which could be (and was) explained to the general public and which could be applied to yield improvements in economic performance benefitting everyone. It seemed an economics as free of ideologi- cal difficulties as, say, applied chemistry or physics, promising a straightforward expansion in economic possibilities. One might argue as to how this windfall should be distributed, but it seemed a simple lapse of logic to oppose the windfall itself. Understandably and correctly, noneconomists met this promise with skepticism at first; the smoothly growing prosperity of the Kennedy-Johnson years did much to diminish these doubts. We dwell on these halcyon days of Keynesian economics because without conscious effort they are difficult to recall today. In the present decade, the U.S. economy has undergone its first major depression since the 1930s, to the accompaniment of inflation rates in excess of 10 percent per annum. These events have been transmitted (by consent of the governments involved) to other advanced countries and in many cases have been amplified. These events did not arise from a reactionary reversion to outmoded, "classical" principles of tight money and balanced budgets. On the contrary, they were accompanied by massive government budget deficits and high rates of monetary expansion, policies which, although bear- ing an admitted risk of inflation, promised according to modern Keynesian doctrine rapid real growth and low rates of unemployment. That these predictions were wildly incorrect and that the doctrine on which they were based is fun- damentally flawed are now simple matters of fact involving no novelties in economic theory. The task now facing contemporary students of the business cycle is to sort through the wreckage, determining which features of that remarkable intellectual event called the Keynesian Revolution can be salvaged and put to good use and which others must be discarded. Though it is far from clear what the outcome of this process will be, it is already evident that it will neces- sarily involve the reopening of basic issues in mone- tary economics which have been viewed since the thirties as "closed" and the reevaluation of every aspect of the institutional framework within which monetary and fiscal policy is formulated in the ad- vanced countries. This paper is an early progress report on this process of reevaluation and reconstruction. We begin by reviewing the econometric framework by means of which Keynesian theory evolved from disconnected, qualitative talk about economic activity into a system of equations which can be compared to data in a systematic way and which provide an operational guide in the necessarily quantitative task of formulat- ing monetary and fiscal policy. Next, we identify those aspects of this framework which were central to its failure in the seventies. In so doing, our intent is to establish that the difficulties are fatal: that modern macroeconomic models are of no value in guiding policy and that this condition will not be remedied by modifications along any line which is currently being pursued. This diagnosis suggests certain principles which a useful theory of business cycles must have. We conclude by reviewing some recent research con- sistent with these principles.},

This switching strategy can be related to the so-called Parrondian games, where the alternation of two losing games yield a winning game. Hence we can consider two dynamics that, by themselves, yield undesirable behaviors, but when alternated yield a desirable oscillatory behavior. In this case, we also consider a noisy switching strategy and find that the desirable oscillatory behavior prevails. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Attention impairment may provide a cohesive neurobiological explanation for clusters of clinical symptoms that occur after a concussion; therefore, objective quantification of attention is needed. Visually tracking a moving target is an attention-dependent sensorimotor function, and eye movement can be recorded easily and objectively to quantify performance. Our previous work suggested the utility of gaze-target synchronization metrics of a predictive visual tracking task in concussion screening and recovery monitoring. Another objectively quantifiable performance measure frequently suggested for concussion screening is simple visuo-manual reaction time (simple reaction time, SRT). Here, we used visual tracking and SRT tasks to assess changes between pre- and post-concussion performances and explore their relationships to post-concussion symptomatology. Athletes participating in organized competitive sports were recruited. Visual tracking and SRT records were collected from the recruited athlete pool as baseline measures over a four-year period. When athletes experienced a concussion, they were re-assessed within two weeks of their injury. We present the data from a total of 29 concussed athletes. Post-concussion symptom burden were assessed with the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire and subscales of the Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire. Post-concussion changes in visual tracking and SRT performance were examined using a paired t-test. Correlations of changes in visual tracking and SRT performance to symptom burden were examined using Pearson's coefficients. Post-concussion changes in visual tracking performance were not consistent among the athletes. However, changes in several visual tracking metrics had moderate to strong correlations to symptom scales ({\textbar}r{\textbar} up to 0.68). On the other hand, while post-concussion SRT performance was reduced (p {$<$} 0.01), the changes in the performance metrics were not meaningfully correlated to symptomatology ({\textbar}r{\textbar} {$\leq$} 0.33). Results suggest that visual tracking performance metrics reflect clinical symptoms when assessed within two weeks of concussion. Evaluation of concussion requires assessments in multiple domains because the clinical profiles are heterogeneous. While most individuals show recovery within a week of injury, others experience prolonged recovery periods. Visual tracking performance metrics may serve as a biomarker of debilitating symptoms of concussion implicating attention as a root cause of such pathologies.},

In premixed flames the focus is on flame-flow interactions that occur during the nonlinear development of hydrodynamically unstable large-scale flames, or during the propagation of curved flames in two-dimensional channels. The second part of the paper deals with non-premixed and partially premixed flames, where the focus is on understanding the nature of diffusive-thermal instabilities including the effect of thermal expansion, and on stabilization mechanisms of edge flames, which possess characteristics of both premixed and diffusion flames. The results presented in this talk illustrate how simplified models, when analyzed to their extreme, yield predictions of qualitative nature with physical insight that have advanced our understanding of combustion. This insight can be used to guide the experimental efforts, explain observations and validate large-scale numerical simulations. {\copyright} 2009 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Some cases of fraud have occurred where cultivated silk garments are sold as wild silk. Samples from these cases, morphological observation using light microscope and polarized microscope have been conducted in forensic science laboratories. Sometimes scanning electron microscopy was also carried out. However, the morphology of silk shows quite wide variation, which makes it difficult to discriminate wild and cultivated silks by this method. In this report, silk discrimination was investigated using conventional instrumental analyses commonly available in forensic laboratories, such as Fourier-transfer infraredspectrometry (FT-IR), pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyr-GC/MS) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). By FT-IR, cultivated and wild silk gave similar infrared spectra, but wild silk had a characteristic peak at 965 cm-1 from the deformation vibration of the carbon-carbon double bond of the indole ring. Comparison of the pyrograms of cultivated and wild silk showed that wild silk had large indole and skatole peaks that cultivated silk did not, and these peaks might arise from tryptophan. The results of thermogravimetry/DTA showed that the endothermic peak was about 40 8C higher for wild silk than for cultivated silk. Using a combination of these results, cultivated and wild silk could be discriminated by common forensic instrumental techniques. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

We apply this model to the logistic map and examine the behavior of the control parameter. We find that the parameter leaves the chaotic regime.

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to reexamine Japan's financial policies from the perspective of the Taylor rule, which has become the standard for assessing financial policies. The Taylor rule is a rule for setting the bank rate, whereby the nominal bank rate is expressed as a linear function of the inflation rate and gross domestic product (GDP) gap. In microeconomic analyses in recent years, the Taylor rule has been increasingly used for setting financial policies, and efforts are being promoted to analyze the rule itself. In this article, I start by presenting the results of an empirical analysis of the Taylor rule in Japan. When analyzing bank rates vis-{\`a}-vis the Taylor rule, the reaction factor of the bank rate to the inflation rate and GDP gap are important. Most empirical analyses show slight differences in the values, but indicate that the values fall within parameters that are largely consistent with the theory. Next, I performed a supplementary examination of these empirical analyses after changing various parameters. Nonetheless, in many cases, I achieved results similar to those produced by previous studies, suggesting that the results of those studies are stable. Finally, I assess the bank rate by comparing the Taylor rule and the actual call rate. The results show that even though the parameter values focused on in the empirical analyses are confirmed, there are several problems to be addressed when it comes to thinking about actual financial policies. Specifically, what indicator reflects the real equilibrium interest rate? What are the prices of goods that the central bank must take into consideration? And what is the potential GDP that is taken into consideration when calculating the GDP gap?},

As of October 2010, 37 states and territories made the CCSS the legal law of their land in terms of the mathematics and language arts curricula used in their public schools. Over 170 organizations, education-related and corporations alike, have pledged their support to the initiative. In this article, the author argues that the evidence presented by its developers, the National Governors Association (NGA) and Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), seems lacking compared to the independent reviews and the available research on the topic that suggest the CCSS and those who support them are misguided. The standards have not been validated empirically and no metric has been set to monitor the intended and unintended consequences they will have on the education system and children. Yet most of the nation's governors, state education leaders, and many education organizations remain committed to the initiative. The author contends that children have a right to a quality education. School leaders, those who prepare them, and the people who lead professional organizations have a duty to help provide the quality. Children do not have a seat at the policy-making table. Policy is thrust upon them, not created with them. They are helpless to defend themselves against poor decision making. They do not have a voice. They have only the voices of the adults who are supposed to know better. The author stresses that if some school leaders and their organizations do not want to stand up for children then they should stand down and let those who are willing assume the leadership reins.},

The model is a synthesis of the leading approaches in the literature. In particular, the framework exhibits a financial accelerator,' in that endogenous developments in credit markets work to amplify and propagate shocks to the macroeconomy. In addition, we add several features to the model that are designed to enhance the empirical relevance. First, we incorporate money and price stickiness, which allows us to study how credit market frictions may influence the transmission of monetary policy. In addition, we allow for lags in investment which enables the model to generate both hump-shaped output dynamics and a lead-lag relation between asset prices and investment, as is consistent with the data. Finally, we allow for heterogeneity among firms to capture the fact that borrowers have differential access to capital markets. Under reasonable parametrizations of the model, the financial accelerator has a significant influence on business cycle dynamics.},

  abstract = {We provide an introduction to optimal fiscal and monetary policy using the primal approach to optimal taxation. We use this approach to address how fiscal and monetary policy should be set over the long run and over the business cycle. We find four substantive lessons for policymaking: Capital income taxes should be high initially and then roughly zero; tax rates on labor and consumption should be roughly constant; state-contingent taxes on assets should be used to provide insurance against adverse shocks; and monetary policy should be conducted so as to keep nominal interest rates close to zero. We begin optimal taxation in a static context. We then develop a general framework to analyze optimal fiscal policy. Finally, we analyze optimal monetary policy in three commonly used models of money: a cash-credit economy, a money-in-the-utility-function economy},

  abstract = {Lecture 1 Norms Definition 0.1. Let K be a field. A norm on K is a function {\textbar} {$\cdot$} {\textbar} : K {$\rightarrow$} R {$\geq$}0 satisfying 1. {$\forall$}x, y {$\in$} K, {\textbar}x + y{\textbar} {$\leq$} {\textbar}x{\textbar} + {\textbar}y{\textbar}. 2. {$\forall$}x, y {$\in$} K, {\textbar}xy{\textbar} = {\textbar}x{\textbar}{\textbar}y{\textbar}. 3. {$\forall$}x {$\in$} K, {\textbar}x{\textbar} = 0 {$\Leftrightarrow$} x = 0. We will refer to the pair (K, {\textbar} {$\cdot$} {\textbar}) as a normed field. Sometimes we will refer to K itself as a normed field, leaving {\textbar} {$\cdot$} {\textbar} implicit. Standard examples are the fields Q, R and C with the usual (Euclidean) norm. Alternatively, any field has the trivial norm that takes any non-zero element to 1. We will suppose in the following that all our norms are in fact non-trivial. Definition 0.2. Fix a prime p. Let x be a non-zero rational number. We can write x = p n a b , where a, b are coprime to p. We then define ord p (x) = n, {\textbar}x{\textbar} p = p - ordp(x) , to be the p-adic valuation and norm of x respectively. Definition 0.3. We say that two norms {\textbar} {$\cdot$} {\textbar} 1 , {\textbar} {$\cdot$} {\textbar} 2 on K are equivalent if there exists {$\alpha$} {$>$} 0 such that {\textbar} {$\cdot$} {\textbar} {$\alpha$} 1 = {\textbar} {$\cdot$} {\textbar} 2. The following theorem will serve as a warm-up for using field norms. Theorem 0.4. Any norm {\textbar} {$\cdot$} {\textbar} on Q is equivalent to either the usual norm or a p-adic norm {\textbar} {$\cdot$} {\textbar} p. Recall that we are assuming all of our norms are non-trivial; otherwise the trivial norm would give a third possibility in the statement of the theorem above. Proof. Let a, b {$>$} 1 be integers, and write b n in base a as follows: b n = c m a m + c m-1 a m-1 + {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} + c 0 , where for each i we have 0 {$\leq$} c i {$\leq$} a - 1. Let M = sup({\textbar}1{\textbar},. .. , {\textbar}a - 1{\textbar}). It follows that {\textbar}b n {\textbar} {$\leq$} {\textbar}c m {\textbar}{\textbar}a m {\textbar} + {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} + {\textbar}c 0 {\textbar} {$\leq$} (m + 1)M max({\textbar}a m {\textbar},. .. , 1) {$\leq$} (n log a (b) + 1)M sup(1, {\textbar}a{\textbar} n log a (b)). * These are the notes for a tutorial given by Jack A.

As a result of limited federal oversight and ambiguities in the law, courts have been influential players in the creation and re-creation of this law. The role of the courts can be seen in the interpretation of such concepts as a free, appropriate public education, medical services, and the least restrictive environment. When politicians are silent or ambiguous on an issue, judges often become the de facto policy makers (Melnick 1994; Van Horn, Baumer, and Gormley 2001). In policy areas such as reproductive rights, school desegregation, and the inclusion of students with disabilities into public schools, the courts have been the original policy makers, and the other institutions of government have responded to their lead (Hamilton 1986; Epstein, Segal, and Johnson 1996; Flemming, Bohte, and Wood 1997; Van Horn, Baumer, and Gormley 2001). As noted by Henry Abra-ham, " If not in political theory, in practice courts do have the last word in statutory construction and constitutional interpretation. They make policy; they make law and they do so at the trial level as well as the appellate level " (Abraham 1986, p. 278).

Comparison of the obtained and standard spectra revealed that the same aromatic hydrocarbons (including, in part: benzene, the xylenes, naphthalene, and methylated naphthalenes) were present in all three samples.

Although the primary purpose of the Model Content Frameworks is to provide a frame for the PARCC assessments, they also are voluntary resources to help educators and those developing curricula and instructional materials.

The airborne solid and liquid particles in the nanometer to micrometer size range influence the energy balance of the Earth, the hydrological cycle, atmospheric circulation, and the abundance of greenhouse and reactive trace gases. Moreover, they play important roles in the reproduction of biological organisms and can cause or enhance diseases. The primary parameters that determine the environmental and health effects of aerosol particles are their concentration, size, structure, and chemical composition. These parameters, however, are spatially and temporally highly variable. The quantification and identification of biological particles and carbonaceous components of fine particulate matter in the air (organic compounds and black or elemental carbon, respectively) represent demanding analytical challenges.

Measures: School records as well as parental ratings of functional academic skills and school competency. Results: Children with severe TBI had consistently high usage of school services and low school competency ratings than children with orthopedic injuries and healthy controls. In contrast, children with complicated-mild/moderate TBI were significantly more likely to receive school support services and have lower competence ratings at 6 years than at 2 years postinjury. Students injured at younger ages had lower functional academic skill ratings than those injured at older ages. Conclusions: These findings highlight the increasing academic challenges faced over time by students with complicated-mild/moderate TBI and the vulnerability of younger children to poorer development of functional academic skills.},

Staggered prices in a utility maximizing framework. Journal of Monetary Economics 12, 383--398.] and three extensions. Our empirical results are as follows. First, we find that adding price indexation improves the fit of Calvo's [1983. Staggered prices in a utility maximizing framework. Journal of Monetary Economics 12, 383--398.] model. Second, models with both staggered price and wage setting dominate models with only price rigidities. Third, introducing wage indexation does not significantly improve the fit. Fourth, all model estimates suggest a high degree of price stickiness. Fifth, the estimates of labor supply elasticity are higher in models with both staggered price and wage contracts. Finally, the estimated inflation parameters of the Taylor rule are stable across models.},

Quantitative and narrative records are used to infer the Federal Reserve's intentions for the federal funds rate around FOMC meetings. This series is regressed on the Federal Reserve's internal forecasts to derive a measure free of systematic responses to information about future developments. Estimates using the new measure indicate that policy has large, relatively rapid, and statistically significant effects on both output and inflation. The effects are substantially stronger and quicker than those obtained using conventional indicators.},

  abstract = {For the past several years the author has been reviewing instructional design theories in an attempt to identify prescriptive principles that are common to the various theories. This paper is a preliminary report of the principles that have been identified by this search. Five first principles are elaborated: (a) Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in solving real-world problems. (b) Learning is promoted when existing knowledge is activated as a foundation for new knowledge. (c) Learning is promoted when new knowledge is demonstrated to the learner. (d) Learning is promoted when new knowledge is applied by the learner. (e) Learning is promoted when new knowledge is integrated into the learner's world. Representative instructional design theories are briefly examined to illustrate how they include these principles. These include: Star Legacy by the Vanderbilt Learning Technology Center, 4-Mat by McCarthy, instructional episodes by Andre, multiple approaches to understanding by Gardner, collaborative problem solving by Nelson, constructivist learning environments by Jonassen, and learning by doing by Schank. It is concluded that, although they use a wide variety of terms, these theories and models do include fundamentally similar principles.},

  abstract = {Expansionary macroeconomic policy is ineffective because, according to the policy ineffectiveness hypothesis (PIH), which is based on the rational expectations hypothesis (REH), it does not affect the real economy. This conclusion is false for several reasons. In their critique on Keynes' theory, Lucas and Sargent (1978) argue that economic agents erroneously react with positive output and labor supply responses to expansionary macroeconomic policy. But they learn the long-run solution of the Lucas/Sargent model, which involves price reactions only, and do not repeat their mistakes when again confronted with expansionary macroeconomic policy. Thus, learning makes expansionary macroeconomic policy in the Lucas/Sargent model ineffective. The PIH is derived from models based on neoclassical micro-foundations where economic agents optimize in a stationary environment in 'logical time.' Experiencing and learning in 'logical time'? In this paper, we take historical time seriously; that is, we investigate what economic agents actually experience regarding the effectiveness of expansionary macroeconomic policy in 'historical time.' We conclude that even if neoclassical micro-foundations are rigorously applied, if economic agents behave as assumed in the Lucas/Sargent model but that they move through time, the economy will not settle at the predicted long run equilibrium. Instead expansionary macroeconomic policy will be perceived as a virtue.},

  abstract = {Minerals make up about 50\% of the volume of most soils. They provide physical support for plants, and create the water- and air-filled pores that make plant growth possible. Mineral weathering releases plant nutrients that are retained by other minerals through adsorption, cation exchange, and precipitation. Minerals are indicators of the amount of weathering that has taken place, and the presence or absence of particular minerals gives clues as to how soils formed. The physical and chemical charac-teristics of soil minerals are important considerations in planning, con-structing, and maintaining buildings, roads, and airports.{\textbackslash}nThe diversity of soil mineralogy and the diverse backgrounds of stu-dents studying the subject for the first time make it difficult to prepare an introduction that will serve the needs of all students. No two authors would approach the subject in exactly the same way or at exactly the same level. The approach taken in this chapter is to develop a core of concepts and terminology needed for understanding subsequent chapters.{\textbackslash}nThe chemical composition of the earth's crust is discussed first, to show that the most abundant elements in the crust are, not surprisingly, the ones most likely to be encountered in soil minerals. Then the chemical and structural classification of minerals is discussed and the major min-erals represented in soils are identified. The phyllosilicate minerals are covered separately because of their major role in soils. Basic structural concepts common to all minerals are covered at this point to provide the background for the discussion of the phyllosilicate structures. The overall structural theme of the phyllosilicates is then presented along with other information about the minerals. The chapter concludes with a dis-cussion of some crystallographic and x-ray diffraction concepts used throughout the book.}

Removal of the whole soil organic matter decreased sorption by approximately 86\% for nonpolar 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (TCB), but only 34-54\% for highly polar 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB); however, removal of the extractable humic/fulvic acids did not much affect sorption of the two sorbates. With normalization of solute hydrophobicity, TNB exhibits several orders of magnitude stronger sorption compared with TCB to maize burn residue (black carbon), extracted humic acid and Na+-saturated montmorillonite clay, suggesting specific sorptive interactions for TNB with the individual model soil components. It was proposed that sorption of TCB to the bulk soil was dominated by hydrophobic partition to the condensed, non-extractable fraction of organic matters (humin/kerogen and black carbon), while interactions with soil clay minerals were an important additional factor for sorption of TNB. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Fourteen of twenty-two experiments exhibit price bubbles followed by crashes relative to intrinsic dividend value. When traders are experienced this reduces, but does not eliminate, the probability of a bubble. The regression of changes in mean price on lagged excess bids (number of bids minus the number of offers in the previous period), P, - Pt\_- = a + f(B,\_1 - O\_l), supports the hypothesis that -a = E(d), the one-period expected value of the dividend, and that f {$>$} 0, where excess bids is a surrogate measure of excess demand arising from homegrown capital gains (losses) expectations. Thus, when (Bt-1 - O \_-) goes to zero we have convergence to rational expectations in the sense of Fama (1970), that arbitrage becomes unprofitable. The observed bubble phenomenon can also be interpreted as a form of temporary myopia (Tirole, 1982) from which agents learn that capital gains expectations are only temporarily sustainable, ultimately inducing common expectations, or "priors" (Tirole, 1982). Four of twenty-six experiments, all using experienced subjects, yield outcomes that appear to the "chart's eye" to converge "early" to rational expectations, although even in these cases we get {$>$} 0, and small price fluctuations of a few cents that invite "scalping.}

One of the most prominent questionable research practices is p-hacking. Typically, p-hacking is defined as a compound of strategies targeted at rendering non-significant hypothesis testing results significant. However, a comprehensive overview of these p-hacking strategies is missing, and current meta-scientific research often ignores the heterogeneity of strategies. Here, we compile a list of 12 p-hacking strategies based on an extensive literature review, identify factors that control their level of severity, and demonstrate their impact on false-positive rates using simulation studies. We also use our simulation results to evaluate several approaches that have been proposed to mitigate the influence of questionable research practices. Our results show that investigating p-hacking at the level of strategies can provide a better understanding of the process of p-hacking, as well as a broader basis for developing effective countermeasures. By making our analyses available through a Shiny app and R package, we facilitate future meta-scientific research aimed at investigating the ramifications of p-hacking across multiple strategies, and we hope to start a broader discussion about different manifestations of p-hacking in practice.}

  abstract = {In many research fields, the widespread use of questionable research practices has jeopardized the credibility of scientific results. One of the most prominent questionable research practices is p-hacking. Typically, p-hacking is defined as a compound of strategies targeted at rendering non-significant hypothesis testing results significant. However, a comprehensive overview of these p-hacking strategies is missing, and current meta-scientific research often ignores the heterogeneity of strategies. Here, we compile a list of 12 p-hacking strategies based on an extensive literature review, identify factors that control their level of severity, and demonstrate their impact on false-positive rates using simulation studies. We also use our simulation results to evaluate several approaches that have been proposed to mitigate the influence of questionable research practices. Our results show that investigating p-hacking at the level of strategies can provide a better understanding of the process of p-hacking, as well as a broader basis for developing effective countermeasures. By making our analyses available through a Shiny app and R package, we facilitate future meta-scientific research aimed at investigating the ramifications of p-hacking across multiple strategies, and we hope to start a broader discussion about different manifestations of p-hacking in practice.}

We were inspired to do this by a recent paper of A. M. Bruckner and Jack Ceder [2], where this theorem, among others, is brought into their interesting discussion of the phenomenon of nonmeasurable sets. We are grateful to Professor R. B. Burckel for calling this paper to our attention. We warmly recommend it to the reader. It is our intention here to present a strictly elementary account of this remarkable fact that will be accessible to readers with very little mathematical background. We do presume a little matrix theory and the elements of real analysis. We first state the main theorem and then give precise definitions before launching into its proof. We may as well admit in advance that its proof depends on Zermelo's Axiom of Choice, which is used in a very obvious way in the proof of Theorem C below (the set C selected there is not specified in a finitely constructable way).},

A taxonomy of racial microaggressions in everyday life was created through a review of the social psychological literature on aversive racism, from formulations regarding the manifestation and impact of everyday racism, and from reading numerous personal narratives of counselors (both White and those of color) on their racial/cultural awakening. Microaggressions seem to appear in three forms: microassault, microinsult, and microinvalidation. Almost all interracial encounters are prone to microaggressions; this article uses the White counselor--client of color counseling dyad to illustrate how they impair the development of a therapeutic alliance.

At cryogenic temperatures, scanning probe microscopy can even provide electron tunnelling spectra that serve as fingerprints of the vibrational properties of adsorbed molecules and of the electronic properties of magnetic impurity atoms, thereby allowing chemical identification. But in many instances, and particularly for insulating systems, determining the exact chemical composition of surfaces or nanostructures remains a considerable challenge. In principle, dynamic force microscopy should make it possible to overcome this problem: it can image insulator, semiconductor and metal surfaces with true atomic resolution, by detecting and precisely measuring the short-range forces that arise with the onset of chemical bonding between the tip and surface atoms and that depend sensitively on the chemical identity of the atoms involved. Here we report precise measurements of such short-range chemical forces, and show that their dependence on the force microscope tip used can be overcome through a normalization procedure. This allows us to use the chemical force measurements as the basis for atomic recognition, even at room temperature. We illustrate the performance of this approach by imaging the surface of a particularly challenging alloy system and successfully identifying the three constituent atomic species silicon, tin and lead, even though these exhibit very similar chemical properties and identical surface position preferences that render any discrimination attempt based on topographic measurements impossible.},

Many of the core questions about thought, language, perception, memory, and knowledge of other people's minds were for centuries the domain of philosophy. The book begins with the philosophical foundations of inquiry into the nature of mind and thought, in particular the writings of Descartes, and then covers the principal topics of cognitive psychology including memory, attention, and decision making. The book organizes a daunting amount of information, underlining the essentials, while also introducing readers to the ambiguities and controversies of research. It is arranged thematically and includes many topics not typically taught in cognition courses, including human factors and ergonomics, evolutionary psychology, music cognition, and experimental design.

Silks can be chemically modified through amino acid side chains to alter surface properties or to immobilize cellular growth factors. Molecular engineering of silk sequences has been used to modify silks with specific features, such as cell recognition or mineralization. The degradability of silk biomaterials can be related to the mode of processing and the corresponding content of {$\beta$}-sheet crystallinity. Several primary cells and cell lines have been successfully grown on different silk biomaterials to demonstrate a range of biological outcomes.

  abstract = {The plant-specific Rop family GTPases are versatile molecular switches in many processes during plant growth, development, and responses to the environment. To understand how Rop achieves its functional versatility in signaling, we performed a genome-wide identification of putative Rop targets using a combination of the yeast two-hybrid method, bioinformatic tools, and a robust functional assay in pollen. In this study, we have identified 11 Arabidopsis genes encoding novel proteins, termed RICs (for Rop-interactive CRIB motif-containing proteins), that contain a CRIB (for Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding) motif required for their specific interaction with GTP-bound Rop1. RICs are divergent and classified into five groups that share little sequence homology outside of the conserved Rop-interactive domain. Overexpression in tobacco pollen tubes of the nine Ric genes that are expressed in Arabidopsis pollen causes distinct phenotypes, implying distinct functions for various RICs. RIC3 (group III) and RIC4 (group V) both cause depolarized growth like Rop1 and display Rop1-enhanced localization to the tip of pollen tubes, suggesting that these RICs may be two distinct targets of Rop1. In contrast, RIC10 (group I) promotes pollen tube elongation but does not affect pollen tube growth polarity and shows Rop1-independent localization to the cytoplasm, suggesting that RIC10 may participate in a Rop1-independent pathway probably controlled by a different Rop. Expression of all other RICs causes various degrees of growth inhibition in pollen tubes. Furthermore, these inhibitory RICs also exhibit distinct patterns of localization in pollen tubes. Our results suggest that various RICs have evolved to interact with Rops differentially and to perform distinct functions in pollen tubes. Reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that six of the nine RICs are expressed in various parts of Arabidopsis plants. On the basis of these observations, we propose that RICs function as Rop GTPase targets that control various Rop-dependent signaling pathways in plants.},

However, the study discovered that the linkage between these variables in Japan differs from that found for the US during the recession in the early 1990s. Japanese newspaper coverage followed the economy and public sentiment at different time-lags. Additionally, the Japanese's confidence level, regardless of the economic condition, can be predicted by the economy indicator but not by the recession coverage. Contrary to the literature, the study finds little direct media impact on either the economy or consumer confidence -- a phenomenon that could be accounted for by the Japanese's deep pessimism about recovery and the longer duration of the recession.},

CRT shifts the research lens away from a deficit view of Communities of Color as places full of cultural poverty disadvantages, and instead focuses on and learns from the array of cultural knowledge, skills, abilities and contacts possessed by socially marginalized groups that often go unrecognized and unacknowledged. Various forms of capital nurtured through cultural wealth include aspirational, navigational, social, linguistic, familial and resistant capital. These forms of capital draw on the knowledges Students of Color bring with them from their homes and communities into the classroom. This CRT approach to education involves a commitment to develop schools that acknowledge the multiple strengths of Communities of Color in order to serve a larger purpose of struggle toward social and racial justice.

  abstract = {A computationally quick and conceptually simple method to recover time delay of the chaotic system from scalar time series is developed in this paper. We show that the orbits in the incomplete two-dimensional reconstructed phase-space will show local clustering phenomenon after the component permutation procedure proposed in this work. We find that information captured by the incomplete two-dimensional reconstructed phase-space, is related to the time delay \$\{{\textbackslash}tau \_0\}\$ present in the system, and will be transferred to the permutation component by the procedure of component permutation. We then propose the segmented mean-variance (SMV) from the permutation component to identify the time delay \$\{{\textbackslash}tau \_0\}\$ of the system. The proposed SMV shows clear maximum when the embedding delay \${\textbackslash}tau \$ of the incomplete reconstruction matches the time delay \$\{{\textbackslash}tau \_0\}\$ of the chaotic system. Numerical data generated by a time-delay system based on the Mackey-Glass equation operating in the chaotic regime are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed SMV. Experimental results show that the proposed SMV is robust to additive observational noise and is able to recover the time delay of the chaotic system even though the amount of data is relatively small and the feedback strength is weak. Moreover, the time complexity of the proposed method is quite low.},

  abstract = {Combining deep model-free reinforcement learning with on-line planning is a promising approach to building on the successes of deep RL. On-line planning with look-ahead trees has proven successful in environments where transition models are known a priori. However, in complex environments where transition models need to be learned from data, the deficiencies of learned models have limited their utility for planning. To address these challenges, we propose TreeQN, a differentiable, recursive, tree-structured model that serves as a drop-in replacement for any value function network in deep RL with discrete actions. TreeQN dynamically constructs a tree by recursively applying a transition model in a learned abstract state space and then aggregating predicted rewards and state-values using a tree backup to estimate Q-values. We also propose ATreeC, an actor-critic variant that augments TreeQN with a softmax layer to form a stochastic policy network. Both approaches are trained end-to-end, such that the learned model is optimised for its actual use in the tree. We show that TreeQN and ATreeC outperform n-step DQN and A2C on a box-pushing task, as well as n-step DQN and value prediction networks (Oh et al. 2017) on multiple Atari games. Furthermore, we present ablation studies that demonstrate the effect of different auxiliary losses on learning transition models.},
